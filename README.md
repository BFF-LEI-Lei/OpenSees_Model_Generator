# OpenSeesPy Building Modeler

**Work in progress. Not usable yet.**

The purpose of this module is to assist the creation of error-free OpenSees models of 3D buildings. The motivation behind this module is to automate tasks that still require repetitive manual calculations (e.g., defining proper beam-column connections and element offsets, applying self-weight, assigning distributed loads on the supporting beams of floors etc.) The module will be in constant development, and new features will be added as needed for my research work. Anyone is welcome to use the code, and feedback is much appreciated.
