# OpenSeesPy Building Modeler

**Work in progress. Not usable yet.**

The purpose of this module is to assist the creation of error-free OpenSees building models of 3D buildings. The motivation behind this module is to automate tasks that still require repetitive manual calculations (e.g., defining proper beam-column connections, applying self-weight, distributing uniformly distributed loads on the supporting beams of a floor etc.) The module is in constant development, and new features are added as needed for my research.
