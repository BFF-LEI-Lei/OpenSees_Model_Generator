![Screenshot](/img/teaser_image.png)

Point-and-click style user interfaces, while convenient, have limited functionality. This restriction often traps the engineer in a tedious process of seemingly endless pointing and clicking to accomplish a relatively simple task. Using python to conduct structural analysis opens the gate to unlimited customization, extensibility, and automation.

This module aims to assist the definition, analysis, and post-processing of 3D OpenSees models.
Anyone is free and welcome to use, fork, extend and redistribute the code.
