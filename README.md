# OpenSeesPy Building Modeler

**Work in progress. Not usable yet.**

The purpose of this module is to assist the creation of OpenSees models of 3D buildings. The motivation behind this module is to automate tasks that require repetitive manual calculations (e.g., defining proper beam-column connections and element offsets, applying self-mass/weight, assigning distributed surface loads on  supporting beams etc.), offering convenience similar to what the preprocessors of professional-grade structural analysis software provide, without the user interface. The module is in constant development, and new features are added as needed for my research. Anyone is free and welcome to use, modify, extend and redistribute the code.
