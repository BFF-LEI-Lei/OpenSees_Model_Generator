# # Excel to JSON
# The following code converts the AISC shapes databse excel file to JSON.
# 
# The original file contains two sections per row. Manual processing must be done before the execution of this code, to create a modified file that contains only one section per row.
# 
# To decrease the lookup time for the subsequent analysis, we only extract data for specific section types.
