* My OpenSees 3D building model creation workflow goal!

** ToDo list

*** Sooner
**** TODO Create an opensees 3D model of a fiber-section steel building in the conventional way. It will be used to recreate it with the modeler and verify the results.

*** Later
**** TODO Add github page URL to the beginning of the files once the thing goes out.



*** The module user should have to do the following
There is a pdf file written in Notability that outlines what the user should do to define the building.

**** Additional things to implement
- [ ] Replicate finished levels upwards


*** The module should have functions that automate the following tasks
- [ ] Use the obtained information to calculate
  - [ ] Center of mass for each diaphragm
  - [ ] Proper element connectivity/offsets etc.
  - [ ] UDL distribution on elements
- [ ] Generate the commands to create the OpenSees model
