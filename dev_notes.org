* Todo List

*** Developing code
Definition stage
- [ ] Floor perimeter
- [ ] UDL
- [ ] Grids from dxf
Analysis stage
- [ ] Distribute UDLs to beams
- [ ] Loads
- [ ] Mass
- [ ] Define in OpenSees

*** Organizing existing code
- [ ] Change input arguments to include tuples
- [ ] Consider changing dataclass arguments to dictionaries, to reduce the number of arguments

* Future plans

*** High priority

- [ ] Be able to create a 3D OpenSeesPy model of a fiber-section steel building. Direct beam-column connections, no offsets. Rigid diaphragm constraints. No support for modification of the defined elements. Load case support. Automatic load and mass distribution.
- [ ] Modal analysis
- [ ] Gravity load case analysis
- [ ] NL Pushover analysis
- [ ] NL time-history analysis
- [ ]

*** Medium priority

- [ ] Basic modifications of previously defined elements (deletion, splitting etc)
- [ ] Replicate finished levels upwards
- [ ] Visualizing deformed shapes
- [ ] Visualizing element forces
- [ ]

**** Low priority

- [ ] Load combination support
- [ ] Code-based design
- [ ] Synthetic ground-motion generation
- [ ] Incremental dynamic analysis support
- [ ] PBEE integration
- [ ]
