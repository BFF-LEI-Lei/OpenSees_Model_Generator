* Todo List

*** Developing code
Visualization
- [ ] Visualize element loads and point masses
- [ ] Be able to plot partially defined models (no elements or no floor perimeter for example)

* General Plan

*** High priority

- [-] Be able to create a 3D OpenSeesPy model of a linear elastic steel building. Direct beam-column connections, no offsets. Rigid diaphragm constraints. No support for modification of the defined elements. No load case support. Automatic load and mass distribution.
  - [X] Modal analysis
  - [X] Gravity load case analysis
  - [ ] NL Pushover analysis
  - [ ] NL time-history analysis
- [X] Expand to support displacement based fiber section beam-column elements
- [ ] Add support for automatic element offsets

*** Medium priority

- [ ] Visualizing frame and floor extrusions
- [ ] Visualizing deformed shapes
- [ ] Visualizing element forces
- [ ] Subasemblies:
  - [ ] Automated braces: X, Chevron, BRB
  - [ ] [Optional] Automated truss (for fun)
- [ ] Non-supporting beams (that don't take any load from the slab)
- [ ] Basic modifications of previously defined elements (deletion, splitting etc)
- [ ] Replicate finished levels upwards

**** Low priority

- [ ] PBEE integration
- [ ] Load combination support
- [ ] Code-based design
- [ ] Synthetic ground-motion generation
- [ ] Incremental dynamic analysis support
- [ ] Read-the-docs-style documentation
