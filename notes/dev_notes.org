* Todo List ~ future plans

*** High priority

- [X] Be able to create a 3D OpenSeesPy model of a linear elastic steel building. Direct beam-column connections, no offsets. Rigid diaphragm constraints. No support for modification of the defined elements. No load case support. Automatic load and mass distribution.
  - [X] Modal analysis
  - [X] Gravity load case analysis
  - [X] NL Pushover analysis
  - [X] NL time-history analysis
- [X] Expand to support displacement based fiber section beam-column elements
- [X] Checks
  - [X] Preprocessing a building that has already been processed should be possible without any unexpected things happening

*** Medium priority

- [ ] Advanced element treatment by the modeler module
  - [ ] element offsets
  - [ ] column placed on existing beam properly splits the beam and adds offests
  - [ ] ability to `select` elements in order to:
    - [ ] add UDL
    - [ ] remove from the model
  - [ ] show selected elements (preprocessing plot that has them highlighted)
  - [ ] auto-select all perimeter beams (to easily apply cladding load)
- [-] Improve visualization
  - [-] Preprocessing
    - [X] ensure ability to plot partially defined models (missing element types)
    - [X] Plotly --> remove plotting a single level, rearrange code
    - [X] Visualizing frame extrusions
    - [X] Visualizing deformed shapes
      - [X] no extruded frames too! (support simply plotting lines)
    - [ ] Visualize element loads and point masses
  - [ ] Postprocessing
    - [ ] Visualizing element basic forces
    - [ ] analysis-dependent color bar support
      - [ ] fiber-section stress capacity ratios

- [ ] Subasemblies:
  - [ ] Automated braces: X, Chevron, BRB
  - [ ] [Optional] Automated truss (for fun)
- [ ] Non-supporting beams (that don't take any load from the slab i.e. coupling)

- [ ] Global code polishing
  - [ ] Complete all docstrings
  - [ ] Replace if statements with assertions wherever appropriate
  - [ ] Add technical notes with URLS
  - [ ] Add examples and validation

**** Low priority

- [ ] Synthetic ground-motion generation
- [ ] PBEE integration
- [ ] Load pattern/combinations
- [ ] Code force-based design
- [ ] Incremental dynamic analysis
- [ ] Read-the-docs-style documentation
